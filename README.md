ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bexxper

Hello everyone! My nickname is Bexxper, and I am currently a student at a public university in Indonesia, majoring in Information Systems.
I chose this field because of my strong interest in technology and how information systems can solve real-world problems.
Throughout my studies, I have been actively involved in various academic and extracurricular activities
including group projects related to application development and data analysis. Additionally, I enjoy playing games and creating random script ðŸ˜„, specially Growtopia.
Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to the field of information technology by helping organizations optimize their systems. I am committed to continuous learning and growth to become a competent professional.
Thank you for listening to my introduction! If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further, please feel free to reach out.
